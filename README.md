- the batch file is for resize the cmd cause idk how to do it without it.

Make sure to install every modules in the instruction.txt

- if you dont want to alway paste your bot token, just paste it in the Token.txt and then in the " Enter your bot token ", only type " token " and it should work
- If you want that in the Rename Guild command it change the pfp other than the H pfp, paste the pfp you want and rename it to server.png
